## Merge develop into master

## Tag the release

Here is an example of how the 3.4 tag ( https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/tree/3.4 ) was created and pushed to GitHub:

    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch
    * develop
      master
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git pull
    Already up-to-date.
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git merge develop
    Updating fdbfe57..6ceb24f
    (snip)
     create mode 100644 tools/installer/dvninstall/readme.md
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git tag
    3.3
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git tag -a 3.4 -m 'merged develop, tagging master as 3.4'
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git tag
    3.3
    3.4
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git push origin 3.4
