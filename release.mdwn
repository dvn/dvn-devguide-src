## Merge develop into master

## Tag the release

Here is an example of how the 3.3 tag ( https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/tree/3.3 ) was created and pushed to GitHub:

    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch
      develop
    * master
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git tag -a 3.3 -m 'tagging master as 3.3'
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git tag
    3.3
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git push origin 3.3
    Counting objects: 1, done.
    Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 172 bytes, done.
    Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@github.com:IQSS/dvn.git
     * [new tag]         3.3 -> 3.3
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$

## Make release available for download

Historically, releases have been made available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvn/files/dvn/ but more recently they have been available at http://dvn.github.io/downloads as well.
