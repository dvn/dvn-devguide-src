## New branching model: develop vs. master

<a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"><img src="../images/master-develop.png" align="right" ></a>

Please note that with the move to git, we are adopting the branching model described at http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

In this branching model there are two persistent branches:

- develop: where all new commits go
- master: where code gets merged and tagged as a release

That is to say, **please make your commits on the develop branch, not the master branch**. 

## Feature branches

> "The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment)." -- http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ 

### Example feature branch: 2656-lucene

First, we create the branch and check it out:

    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch
      2656-solr
    * develop
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch 2656-lucene
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ 
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch
      2656-lucene
      2656-solr
    * develop
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git checkout 2656-lucene
    Switched to branch '2656-lucene'
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ 
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git status
    # On branch 2656-lucene
    nothing to commit (working directory clean)
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ 

Then, we make a change and a commit, and push it to https://github.com/iqss/dvn/tree/2656-lucene (creating a new remote branch):

    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ vim src/DVN-EJB/src/java/edu/harvard/iq/dvn/core/index/Indexer.java
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ 
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git commit -m 'start lucene faceting branch' src/DVN-EJB/src/java/edu/harvard/iq/dvn/core/index/Indexer.java
    [2656-lucene 3b82f88] start lucene faceting branch

    To git@github.com:IQSS/dvn.git
     * [new branch]      2656-lucene -> 2656-lucene
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ 

As we work on the feature branch, we merge the latest changes from "develop". We want to resolve conflicts in the feature branch itself so that the feature branch will merge cleanly into "develop" when we're ready. In the example below, we use `git mergetool` and `opendiff` to resolve conflicts and save the merge. Then we push the newly-merged 2656-lucene feature branch to GitHub.

    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch
    * 2656-lucene
      2656-solr
      develop
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git checkout develop
    murphy:dvn pdurbin$ git branch
      2656-lucene
      2656-solr
    * develop

## Switching to the master branch to merge commits from the develop branch

We should really only need to switch from the develop branch to the master branch as we prepare for a release.

First, we check out the master branch by clicking Team -> Git -> Branch -> Switch to Branch.

Change Branch to "origin/master" and check the box for "Checkout as New Branch" and fill in "master" as the "Branch Name" to match the name of the branch we're switching to. Then click "Switch".

Now, in the Git Repository Browser (from Team -> Repository Browser) the root of the tree should say `dvn [master]` and you should see two branches under Branches -> Local. **master** should be in bold and develop should not.

FIXME: explain how to merge commits into master for a final release (and how to tag the release)
