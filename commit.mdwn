## Committing changes

By following the instructions in the [[build]] step, you should be in the "develop" branch, which is where we want to make commits as we work toward the next release.

You can verify which branch you are on by clicking Team then "Repository Browser".

You should see `dvn [develop]` at the root of the tree and **develop** in bold under Branches -> Local

Click Team, then "Show Changes". Select the desired files and right-click to commit.

To publish your changes on GitHub, you'll need to follow the next step: [[push]].
