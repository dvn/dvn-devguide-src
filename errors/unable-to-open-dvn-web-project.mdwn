If you are seeing errors such as

"Unable to find the sources roots for the project DVN-web"

or

"DVN-web: Cannot find the Web Pages folder. Open the project properties and in the Sources category browse the correct Web Pages
folder"

you probably have lost your project.properties and project.xml files. The [[build]] page has instructions on putting them back into place.
