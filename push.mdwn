## Pushing your commits to GitHub

After making your [[commit]], push it to GitHub by clicking Team -> Remote -> Push, then Next (to use your configured remote repository), then checking **develop** and Finish.

Your commit should now appear on GitHub in the develop branch: https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/commits/develop

Your commit should **not** appear in the master branch on GitHub: https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/commits/master  . Not yet anyway. Remember, we only merge commits into master when we are ready to release.
