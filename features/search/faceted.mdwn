In https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/2656 faceted search is being added to DVN to replace non-faceted search:

[[!toc levels=3]]

## Home page - DONE

http://localhost:8080/dvn/

### Suggested search - DONE

User clicks one of the suggested terms on the home page.

### Basic search  - DONE

User enters a query from the home page.

## Advanced search page - PARTIAL

http://localhost:8080/dvn/faces/AdvSearchPage.xhtml

### Basic search from the advanced search page - DONE

This works exactly as basic search from above. The same code is included in the page.

### Study Cataloging Information - DONE

This is similar to basic search but you can add "contains" or "does not contain" for various fields at once:

- Title
- Producer
- Production Date
- Time Period Covered Start 

### Tabular Data Variable Information

This search looks into the variables of uploaded files (tab-separated, Stata, SPSS, etc.).

### FITS File Information

## New search from study listing page - DONE

A fast way to get to the study listing page is by clicking a suggested term from the homepage: http://localhost:8080/dvn/

## Subsearch ("within these results" after a search)

You are given the option to check this box after search from the home page or the advanced search page.

## Dataverse-specific search

http://localhost:8080/dvn/dv/mra (for example).  From the landing page for a dataverse, searches are automatically narrowed to be within that dataverse (seemingly whether or not "within this collection" is checked).

Adding facets to this search is complicated. In this search, the list of studyIds from the dataverse is passed as a parameter and the results are filtered down to only studies from the dataverse. In order to filter facet results down to the dataverse, we'll need to alter the query. See https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/blob/b40c4a0736a5b51df29d45dfc0af2a68ba6c5274/src/DVN-EJB/src/java/edu/harvard/iq/dvn/core/index/Indexer.java#L892

## All studies listing - PARTIAL

From the home page you can click "view more" to see a list of all studies at http://localhost:8080/dvn/faces/StudyListingPage.xhtml?mode=100 and we probably want to have facets there.

Code to do a MatchAllDocsQuery has been added but commented out and is not well tested and may need a re-write.

## Dynamic collections

Dynamic collections are configured within a dataverse: http://guides.thedata.org/book/manage-collections

## OAI Harvesting Sets - DONE

OAI harvesting is configured at the DVN level: http://guides.thedata.org/book/manage-oai-harvesting-sets

Facets results have not been added as they are not necessary (only a simple list of IDs ir required) but we should ensure that changes have not broken the search used by OAI harvesting sets.
