In https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/2656 faceted search is being added to DVN to replace non-faceted search:

[[!toc levels=3]]

## Home page - DONE

http://localhost:8080/dvn/

### Suggested search - DONE

User clicks one of the suggested terms on the home page.

### Basic search  - DONE

User enters a query from the home page.

## Advanced search page - PARTIAL

http://localhost:8080/dvn/faces/AdvSearchPage.xhtml

### Basic search from the advanced search page - DONE

This works exactly as basic search from above. The same code is included in the page.

### Study Cataloging Information - DONE

This is similar to basic search but you can add "contains" or "does not contain" for various fields at once:

- Title
- Producer
- Production Date
- Time Period Covered Start 

### Tabular Data Variable Information

This search looks into the variables of uploaded files (tab-separated, Stata, SPSS, etc.).

### FITS File Information

## Subsearch ("within these results" after a search)

You are given the option to check this box after search from the home page or the advanced search page.

## Dataverse-specific search

http://localhost:8080/dvn/dv/mra (for example).  From the landing page for a dataverse, searches are automatically narrowed to be within that dataverse (seemingly whether or not "within this collection" is checked).

## All studies listing - PARTIAL

From the home page you can click "view more" to see a list of all studies at http://localhost:8080/dvn/faces/StudyListingPage.xhtml?mode=100 and we probably want to have facets there.

Code has been added but commented out because retrieving all the facets slows down the listing.

## Dynamic collections

Dynamic collections are configured within a dataverse: http://guides.thedata.org/book/manage-collections

## OAI Harvesting Sets

OAI harvesting is configured at the DVN level: http://guides.thedata.org/book/manage-oai-harvesting-sets
