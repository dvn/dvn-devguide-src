In https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/2656 faceted search is being added to DVN to replace non-faceted search (where appropriate, per a [[roadmap]]). The [[status]] page summarizes the items below.

[[!toc levels=3]]

http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/ is the place to test faceted search because war files built from the latest code at https://github.com/iqss/dvn/tree/2656-lucene are deployed there periodically.

## Home page - DONE

http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/

### Suggested search - DONE

User clicks one of the suggested terms on the home page.

### Basic search  - DONE

User enters a query from the home page.

## Advanced search page - PARTIAL

http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/faces/AdvSearchPage.xhtml

### Basic search from the advanced search page - DONE

This works exactly as basic search from above. The same code is included in the page.

### Study Cataloging Information - DONE

This is similar to basic search but you can add "contains" or "does not contain" for various fields at once:

- Title
- Producer
- Production Date
- Time Period Covered Start 

### Tabular Data Variable Information

This search looks into the variables of uploaded files (tab-separated, Stata, SPSS, etc.).

### FITS File Information

## New search from study listing page - DONE

A fast way to get to the study listing page is by clicking a suggested term from the homepage: http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/

## Subsearch ("within these results" after a search)

You are given the option to check this box after search from the home page or the advanced search page.

## Dataverse pages - PARTIAL

### Dataverse landing page?

http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/mra (for example).  From the landing page for a dataverse, the number of studies shown corresponds to that dataverse. That is, a search is performed.  Should we show faceted search results here? This is similar in concept to showing faceted results on the "all studies listing" page.

### New dataverse-specific search - DONE

http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/mra (for example).  From the landing page for a dataverse, searches are automatically narrowed to be within that dataverse (seemingly whether or not "within this collection" is checked).

As of https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/commit/5debbd9 dataverse-specific search is based on facets (and seems to be working) which means that `+$facets:dvName?Murray Research Archive Original Collection` (for example) is appended to the normal query.

### Subsearch ("within these results") after a search from a dataverse page

This will probably be solved when the main "within these results" area is refactored.

## All studies listing - PARTIAL

From the home page you can click "view more" to see a list of all studies at http://dvn-3.hmdc.harvard.edu/dvn/faces/StudyListingPage.xhtml?mode=100 and we probably want to have facets there.

Code to do a MatchAllDocsQuery has been added but commented out and is not well tested and may need a re-write.

## Dynamic collections

Dynamic collections are configured within a dataverse: http://guides.thedata.org/book/manage-collections

## OAI Harvesting Sets - DONE

OAI harvesting is configured at the DVN level: http://guides.thedata.org/book/manage-oai-harvesting-sets

Facets results have not been added as they are not necessary (only a simple list of IDs ir required) but we should ensure that changes have not broken the search used by OAI harvesting sets.
