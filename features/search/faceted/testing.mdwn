## Testing search from dataverse context, with an emphasis on collections

A root collection can be:

- default
- static: studies added, maybe from other dataverses
- dynamic: studies added, maybe from other dataverses

The "local" column is for the number of studies owned by that dataverse.

The numbers under the "static" and "dynamic" columns represent the number of this type of child collection.

The "titleSearch" column will be used to record the results from testing various values under "Title" using advanced search.
